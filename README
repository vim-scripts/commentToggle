A little script for toggling commenting on a per line basis:
 toggling means that commenting is turned on and off with one shortcut ("\;" by default), and
 per line basis means that it only uses single line comments (greater flexibility).

In theory, should work for all filetypes; in practice it probably won't. As of version 0.1, definitions are included for 56 languages, and for all the others, it attempts to guess the comment symbol.
